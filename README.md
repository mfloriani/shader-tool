# Shader Tool

![Demo](misc/ShaderToolDemo.gif)

It is a rendering application developed as the final project for my MSc in Computer Science for Game Development.
Through this application you can run simple HLSL shader code connecting nodes in a node graph.
The project was implemented in C++ and DirectX 12.

Note: For the first run you will need to dock the node graph viewport to the center slot of the screen by dragging and dropping it.

## Build

1. Download [Premake5](https://premake.github.io/download) and move the `.exe` into the project root folder.
2. Run `generate_project.bat`
3. Open the project and build it
